[00:00:00.180] speaker 1:
I just don't have it recorded again.

[00:00:04.980] speaker 2:
Okay.

[00:00:05.400] speaker 2:
Well, I guess we didn't miss anything.

[00:00:07.800] speaker 2:
I'll start the pioneer cemetery discussion again.

[00:00:11.280] speaker 2:
I sent you out the summary of the history of what's happening with the pioneer cemetery and the funds that we had received from the association to take care of that.

[00:00:21.840] speaker 2:
I would like to refer this to the finance committee because someone just suggested to me today that maybe there's a local landscape company or somebody who would like to take this on through the summer, we're paying you know between $4 million 505,000 for mowing twice a year.

[00:00:39.780] speaker 2:
And it's possible that we could get somebody a nice summer job to come up there

[00:00:43.680] speaker 2:
and they wouldn't have to do it all in one day.

[00:00:46.440] speaker 2:
They could just take care of it.

[00:00:47.820] speaker 2:
Maybe through May through, say, September even.

[00:00:51.480] speaker 2:
So I'd like to refer that to the finance committee for them to come back with a recommendation.

[00:00:58.800] speaker 2:
Okay.
